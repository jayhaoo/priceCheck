# priceCheck

I made this web scraper as a way to check the prices of clothing and shoes I would like to buy later.
It takes a while to type in all the information in the browser only to get a response so why not send the http GET faster to get all the information faster. 

### How it works
Takes in a text file and reads through them in order to get the information for the items wanted to be searched.
```
'brand' 'url link' 'price' 'product name'
```
